## What this repository contains:
C# scripts I coded in Unity for my Knowledge Exchange Project with IBM to produce a learning entertainment game during my final year Academic project. Feel free to look through.

Short Overview: Procedural level generation (nature type and also roads), procedural ability generation, Q&A system making use of LLMUnity, combat system (ranged and melee support), player related features (health, movement, camera controlling etc)

**My Computer Science BSc Final Year Knowledge Exchange Project with IBM**

## What I produced
> A Solo Developed 3D Roguelike Entertainment Learning Game in Unity to guide a learner through the [SkillsBuild](https://skillsbuild.org/) platform
using traditional Video Game mechanics in conjunction with LLMs and TTS.

> Procedural Level Generation with assets from the Unity Asset store, Unity Terrain and noise (using [FastNoiseLite](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite))
>
>> A Nature themed level
>
>> A City themed level with a coherent road system
>
>> A Desert themed level
>
>> A Space themed level

> A Procedural ability system

> A Combat system allowing the use of ranged (a bow, 1 handed guns, 2 handed guns) and melee weapons (although the same animation is used)

> Modelling, rigging and animations of a player and enemy character (the enemy is a fork of the player design)
>
>> Developed in Blender

> A gamified question and answer system using Large Language Models to provide questions and evaluate student answers, granting a new ability if correct.
>> Model in question was a 4 bit quantised [Phi-4 (14B)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/aiplatformblog/introducing-phi-4-microsoft%E2%80%99s-newest-small-language-model-specializing-in-comple/4357090)
